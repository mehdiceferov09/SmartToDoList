# Smart To Do List
This is a console app which helps you track your to do list. 
You can enter new task, complete a task that you have entered before or complete all of the tasks.

# How it works? 
When you add a new task the program creates a txt file so that you never lose your tasks.
When you want to check your tasks it turns that txt file to a list then iterates through it and shows your current tasks.
When you complete a task it deletes that task from your list and resets the txt file.
